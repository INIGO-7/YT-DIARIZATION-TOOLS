# YT-DIARIZATION-TOOLS

## Description
**YouTube diarization tools** automatically diarizes YouTube videos, creating detailed dataframes with speaker-tagged textual interventions. It's perfect for researchers, content creators, and anyone interested in analyzing spoken content in YouTube videos.

## Usage
> Be guided by the [transcribe-and-diarize.ipynb](YT-DIARIZATION-TOOLS/whisper-speaker-recognition/transcribe-and-diarize.ipynb) notebook under YT-DIARIZATION-TOOLS/whisper-speaker-recognition to get separated diarizations and transcriptions of the requested youtube videos\
> \
> Be guided by the [consistency-checker.ipynb](YT-DIARIZATION-TOOLS/consistency-checker.ipynb) notebook under YT-DIARIZATION-TOOLS to link the diarizations and transcriptions obtained before into one data output in the desired dataframe format.


## Features üìã
- **Automatic Speaker Recognition:** Identifies and tags different speakers in the video.
- **Textual Intervention Extraction:** Transcribes spoken content and associates it with the corresponding speaker.
- **Exportable Dataframe:** Outputs data in a user-friendly .csv format.

## Disclaimer ‚ùó
The tool we use for the diarizations is pyannote.audio, which works really well except for one issue. It consumes an enourmous amount of RAM memory. For videos under 10-15 minutes it will analyze it in a single run, but for longer ones it will eat RAM until the system runs out of it and the kernel crashes.

To overcome this issue we split the audio and then feed it into the diarization pipeline, but this raises another problem. The diarizations recognize speakers by the name SPEAKER_00, SPEAKER_01, ..., but different splits may have different speaker names. That is why we have to manually listen to every split and link the speaker name -SPEAKER_00, 01, etc- to the real name of that speaker (The repository has the data for diarizations of some podcasts, we can see this speaker-to-name mappings in speakers.py). This can be tedious if we have, for example, many podcasts to process, but we have currently not found another way.
